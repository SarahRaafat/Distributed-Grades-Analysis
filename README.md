Distributed Grades Analysis
This project contains two Python-based assignments from the Distributed Systems and Web Services course (Spring 2025). Both assignments analyze student grade data using distributed computing concepts such as MapReduce and thread-safe multithreading.

Project Contents
Assignment 1: MapReduce Methodology
Analyzes student grades using MapReduce logic.

Tasks include:

Calculating average grades per course.

Calculating average grades per university.

Identifying top 3 grades per year.

Input: coursegrades.txt dataset.

Output: Structured results based on aggregation and sorting.

Assignment 2: Thread-Safe Data Addition
Demonstrates safe concurrent data entry using Python threads and binary locks.

Simulates multiple threads adding data to a shared dataset.

Verifies dataset consistency with and without synchronization.

Highlights importance of thread synchronization to avoid data corruption.
